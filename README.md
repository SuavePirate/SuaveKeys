# SuaveKeys

SuaveKeys is a distributed voice and expression controller to enable people with physical impairments to use their voice, expressions, and motor skills to play games and use tools across any device any where they go.

## Platforms

SuaveKeys' goal is to provide support for any user on any devices and includes input support from:
- Alexa: Voice Input
- Google Assistant: Voice input
- Windows: Voice and expression input
- Android: Voice and expression input
- iOS: Voice and expression input


## Extensions

SuaveKeys' can be extended by developers to allow for more input devices for more users! For example check out:
- Using Snapchat custom lenses to handle expression inputs with social abilities: https://github.com/SuavePirate/SuaveKeys.SnapReader
- Using twitch chat to control someone else's games: https://github.com/SuavePirate/SuaveKeys.TwitchBot
